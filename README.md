# Dungeon Blocks Community Maps

![Dungeon Blocks Builder](https://dl2.myminifactory.com/images/campaign/05eeaa5a-dungeon-blocks-builder.png)

This repository is intended for sharing community made Dungeon Blocks maps.

I have seen a lot of community members sharing their maps with different cloud storage solutions. This is great, but it can be hard to keep track on all the different links, as well as getting updates.

## Contribution

Fork the project, and create a folder with your username under the `maps` folder. Then place your maps in a subfolder for the "project".
Example: `./maps/${username}/${campaign-setting}`

Be sure to add a screenshot of the map, with the same name.

Then submit a PR.

## Going forward

* Planning to add rules for enforcing the folder structure, file names etc.

If the project gets traction, it would be nice to create a frontend for the reposity, showing the preview-image with a download button, tags for setting and location and such. This would be really useful for filtering to find different users rendition of locations from common adventure modules.

This project is in no way affiliated with the team behind Dungeon Blocks, and is purely created to have a central place to share community made maps.
